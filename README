* The Qt frontend requires the use of "uic" from the Qt Designer. Qt
Designer is included with Qt v2.3.0, and probably slightly earlier
versions, too - but I don't think it's present in Qt 2.0.x or 2.1.x.

* Services required by plugins and libgalan code should be abstracted
into ADTs. The implementations should be provided by the
frontend. This keeps us platform- and toolkit-neutral. See, for
example, Galan::IOManager and its subclass QtIOManager. Other
abstractions that will be useful include object save/load facilities
and the backing store for the preferences system.
