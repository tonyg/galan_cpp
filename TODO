- get rid of nasty clicking! prebuffer?
- more sensible display of names
	- short names?
	- user comments on icons?
- online help
	- individual plugins should have their own help contexts

- pattern editor
	- use RANDOM-ACCESS human-interaction plugin
- control windows
	- use REALTIME human-interaction plugin
- simple prefs system
	- for prefs editing
- simple object-store system - use XML?
	- for load/store of workspaces and macros
- allow creation/editing/import/export of Macros
- tie in with Brahms?
	- REALTIME MIDI plugin

- clean up API so that it uses more pimpl/bridge/whatever to hide
  symbols and implementation details so we can improve binary compatibility
- cursor changes during link-creation etc
- write a simple MPS-based interface (??)
- write a win32 frontend (maybe a GTK+ one?) - if I can be bothered -
  otherwise use Java and use MPS to communicate
- make plugin-loading use the correct extension for the platform (.so
  on linux, .dll on win32, .sl on HPUX, etc. etc.)
