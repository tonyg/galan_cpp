- don't let a link be drawn if either the source has no outputs, or
  the target has no inputs
- get rid of nasty clicking! prebuffer?

- pattern editor
- control windows
- simple prefs system
	- for prefs editing
- simple object-store system - use XML?
	- for load/store of workspaces and macros

- clean up API so that it uses more pimpl/bridge/whatever to hide
  symbols and implementation details so we can improve binary compatibility
- write a simple MPS-based interface (??)
- write a win32 frontend (maybe a GTK+ one?) - if I can be bothered -
  otherwise use Java and use MPS to communicate
- make plugin-loading use the correct extension for the platform (.so
  on linux, .dll on win32, .sl on HPUX, etc. etc.)
