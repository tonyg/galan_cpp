- clean up directory structure
- add file-readiness-notification API for plugins to use
- pull out the little stub main
- clean up API so that it uses more pimpl/bridge/whatever to hide
  symbols and implementation details so we can improve binary compatibility
- write a Qt frontend
- write a simple MPS-based interface (??)
- write a win32 frontend (maybe a GTK+ one?) - if I can be bothered -
  otherwise use Java and use MPS to communicate
- make plugin-loading use the correct extension for the platform (.so
  on linux, .dll on win32, .sl on HPUX, etc. etc.)
